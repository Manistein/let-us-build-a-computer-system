WARNING:Pack:1653 - At least one timing constraint is impossible to meet because component delays alone exceed the constraint. A timing
   constraint summary below shows the failing constraints (preceded with an Asterisk (*)). Please use the Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE
   (command line) with the Mapped NCD and PCF files to identify which constraints and paths are failing because of the component delays
   alone. If the failing path(s) is mapped to Xilinx components as expected, consider relaxing the constraint. If it is not mapped to
   components as expected, re-evaluate your HDL and how synthesis is optimizing the path. To allow the tools to bypass this error, set the
   environment variable XIL_TIMING_ALLOW_IMPOSSIBLE to 1.


   For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing Analyzer Reference manual; for more information on TRCE,
   consult the Xilinx Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
INFO:Timing:3284 - This timing report was generated using estimated delay 
   information.  For accurate numbers, please refer to the post Place and Route 
   timing report.
Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.

WARNING:Place:1206 - This design contains a global buffer instance,
   <sys_pll_m0/clkout1_buf>, driving the net, <cmos_xclk_OBUF>, that is driving
   the following (first 30) non-clock load pins off chip.
   < PIN: cmos_xclk.O; >
   This design practice, in Spartan-6, can lead to an unroutable situation due
   to limitations in the global routing. If the design does route there may be
   excessive delay or skew on this net. It is recommended to use a Clock
   Forwarding technique to create a reliable and repeatable low skew solution:
   instantiate an ODDR2 component; tie the .D0 pin to Logic1; tie the .D1 pin to
   Logic0; tie the clock net to be forwarded to .C0; tie the inverted clock to
   .C1. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was
   applied on COMP.PIN <sys_pll_m0/clkout1_buf.O> allowing your design to
   continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the
   specified COMP.PIN.

   This is not a recommended design practice in Spartan-6 due to limitations in
   the global routing that may cause excessive delay, skew or unroutable
   situations.  It is recommended to only use a BUFG resource to drive clock
   loads. Please pay extra attention to the timing and routing of this path to
