WARNING:ConstraintSystem:195 - The TNM 'sys_clk_pin', does not directly or
   indirectly drive any flip-flops, latches and/or RAMs and will be removed from
   the design.  This TNM is used in the following user groups and/or
   specifications:
   <TIMESPEC TS_sys_clk_pin = PERIOD sys_clk_pin 50000 kHz;> [pll_test.ucf(3)]

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:197 - The following specification is invalid because
   the referenced TNM constraint was removed:
   <TIMESPEC TS_sys_clk_pin = PERIOD sys_clk_pin 50000 kHz;> [pll_test.ucf(3)]

Done...
