Phase 2.7  Design Feasibility Check
WARNING:Place:1137 - This design is not guaranteed to be routable! This design
   contains a global buffer instance, <video_pll_m0/clkout1_buf>, driving the
   net, <video_clk>, that is driving the following (first 30) non-clock load
   pins.
   < PIN: lcd_dclk1_INV_0.A6; >
   This is not a recommended design practice in Spartan-6 due to limitations in
   the global routing that may cause excessive delay, skew or unroutable
   situations.  It is recommended to only use a BUFG resource to drive clock
   loads. Please pay extra attention to the timing and routing of this path to
   ensure the design goals are met. This is normally an ERROR but the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN
   <video_pll_m0/clkout1_buf.O> allowing your design to continue. This
   constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
